## Dayout

An event discovery Android application built with React Native framework.

### Exploring Dayout: Innovating Event Hosting and Discovery

Dayout is an Android platform designed for event hosting and discovery, prioritizing smaller-scale gatherings. In response to the 2019 pandemic's impact on real-life interactions, our team aimed to create a solution that fosters engagement between people, finding other societies and interacting with a broad range of people.

## Design Thinking Process

We applied the design thinking process to understand user needs by employing various methodologies, including questionnaires, interviews and empathy mapping. Through rigorous brainstorming sessions and comprehensive research of existing applications, we made questionnaires and conducted interviews to unravel the underlying desires of our target users.

Design Thinking Process:

- Empathize
- Define
- Ideate
- Prototype
- Test

The interview results were then used to draw conclusions to list out challenges faced by the users, their needs and their wishes for the application. We also map out user types by using persona and used it to create journey maps to show each persona moving through the task and empathy mapping to list their potential feelings. These also show their experiences to foster a deeper understanding of their motivations and pain points.

## Prototypes

In this whole project, we create two prototypes with low and high fidelity prototypes and the final beta prototypes. We first created these prototypes with Figma which is a design tool to build up a product without code. This enabled us to conduct usability tests, ensuring that our interface seamlessly aligned with user objectives and expectations.

We used the Agile development method for these stages so we could have an iterative approach to revise our interface. We listened to user feedback and refined our prototype to ensure Dayout evolved to meet user needs effectively. I believe this method is great for continuous improvement and getting closer to meeting user goals, fulfilling problems and requirements.
