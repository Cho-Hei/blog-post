## GeekKeys

A online store to sell various keyboards

## Experiences

This is a single page application that have no backend as I was just starting to learn the features of NextJS and writing how to code in Typescript. I didn't expect to go that far and put that much effort but I managed to put up a funcational application. There are a lot of improvements to look at and it is something that I want to revise and remake as currently the code are quite messy.
