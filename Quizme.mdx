## QuizMe

Inspired by Kahoot, this application allows teachers to set up class quizzes for students. Students will choose the answer(s) for each question to test their knowledge of their learning. The question type can be either a multiple-choice question or a single-choice question.

## Features

Teachers can type up questions and answers for each question. They have the option to control which type of question it is, the time allowed to answer, the content of the question (text, photo, Youtube video) and the amount of mark.

Students can join the session when the teacher starts up a quiz which generates a session code. They can join as a guest and use the code to join the session. Once the session starts, they will see the questions and answers that they need to choose within the time limit.

After all the questions are answered, there will be a result dashboard for teachers and students. The teacher dashboard can see the overall performance for the whole class (Student with the most correct answers, Correct answer rates for each question). As for the students, they will also see their performance for the quiz (Percentage of correct answers, Answer and student's answer for each question).
