## HiveLocal HK

_This application is in development and features may change in future. It may includes some bugs and errors._

Information board for different facilities in Hong Kong.

## Features

Most map applications, such as Google Maps and Apple Maps, are primarily designed for navigation and locating commonly recognized landmarks. These landmarks are typically buildings or large areas. However, small or mobile facilities often go unnoticed on these platforms due to limited awareness. This application addresses that gap by enabling users to find and explore these overlooked facilities.

Currently, the app includes only a few facilities, but more will be added over time. Users can select the type of facility they are looking for and view its location. For instance, users can track the changing weekly locations of coin carts and even anticipate future locations.

## Acknowledgment

This application utilizes APIs from Data.gov.hk (開放數據平台) and map data provided by the Lands Department (地政總署).
